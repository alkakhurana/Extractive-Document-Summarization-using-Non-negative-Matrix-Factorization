    Time ran out for the U.S. athletes when the Winter Olympics ended Sunday, with a team headed by Brent Rushlaw a tick away from a U.S. bobsled medal and Dutch speed skater Yvonne van Gennip a triple gold medalist with time to spare.
The 250 figure skaters who performed included past and present medal winners as well as young skaters from Albertville, France, site of the 1992 Winter Games, and Seoul, South Korea, site of this year's summer Games.
Earlier Sunday, Rushlaw and his three team members missed winning the first U.S. bobsled medal in 32 years when they was beaten by .02 seconds for the bronze.
